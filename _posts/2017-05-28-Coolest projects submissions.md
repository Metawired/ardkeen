CoderDojo Coolest Projects was created to encourage, support and showcase the creativity within the CoderDojo community. With CoderDojo, young people can make their most exciting ideas a reality.

Coolest Projects give CoderDojo members the opportunity to work towards a goal by developing an idea from concept through to development and launch. It allows CoderDojo members to take what they have learned at CoderDojo to a whole new level.
